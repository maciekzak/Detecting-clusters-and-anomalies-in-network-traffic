This project aims to detect clusters and anomalies in network traffic using the UNSW_NB15 dataset and the Decision Tree Classifier and K-means algorithms.
The goal is to identify unusual patterns or behaviors in the data, which may indicate potential security threats or network misuse.
Data used for this project comes from https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset.
